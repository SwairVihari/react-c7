        <p>
        "At first, when I heard the interview with Warne, I thought he was joking. Making money from home is only a dream. I decided to try it anyway given my financial circumstances- and for the sake of good journalism.
        </p>

        <p>
        I watched an introductory video about the platform and then signed up. The video seemed to be over-promising but I put my skepticism aside. Within a few hours, I received a call from my personal investor. He answered all questions and doubts I had, and assured me I was going to make money. Period.
        </p>


        <p>
        My personal investor even promised that if 
       <span className={Styles.bold}> I lose even a single dime,</span>
         he would promptly refund my AU$350 deposit. That's how confident he was this was going to change my life. Now that’s customer service beyond anything I’ve seen and no wonder banks are scared.
        </p>

        <p>
        Once I received access to the platform, I deposited my initial investment of AU$350. That's about is what my family spends on junk food every month, so I decided to stop taking us to fast food for a month. Now we can be healthy, plus have the opportunity to get rich.
        </p>

        <p>
        The Immediate Edge system itself is a cryptocurrency auto-trading platform. The software uses advanced AI algorithms and machine learning to predict exactly when cryptocurrencies will go up and down. Then it will automatically buy and sell for you around the clock. Technology has already made our lives easier in every possible way, so why not use it to make more money as well?"

        ZACH'S REAL TIME RESULTS WITH THE SYSTEM
        </h6>

        <p>
        "Within 1 hour of depositing AU$350, the software started trading for me. To be honest, I was nervous it would lose all of my money. And sure enough, my first trade was a AU$25 loss!
        </p>

        <p>
        I felt my throat close up. I thought I had been scammed. I was even ready to call my personal investor and ask for my money back. But then I remembered what my he told me earlier on our call: 
        <span className={Styles.bold}>The algorithm is right about 80-89% of the time. </span>
        You’re not going to win EVERY trade, but you'll win enough and be profitable overall.
        </p>

        <p>
        So I let the software keep trading for me and watched it closely.
        <span className={Styles.bold}> The next trade was profitable! </span>
          Only AU$19 but it was still something. Then the next trade was 
         <span> AU$51 </span> 
           profit. Then 
          <span> AU$22 </span>
            profit, making a total profit of 
           <span> AU$67 </span>
            . And this was all under 5 minutes!
        </p>

        <p>
        Soon I started scooping up cash like ice-cream and I couldn’t believe my eyes. Every time I refreshed the screen, my profits grew higher and higher. I felt like I was on drugs because this was such an exciting rush.

        Now I know why Shane Warne is in a good mood all the time. And why the big banks don’t want people anywhere near this wealth loophole. By the end of the day, 
        <span className={Styles.bold}> I had made over AU$754 </span>
         in profit AUD, not bad from a starting investment of AU$350! I was so excited I barely got any sleep.

        <p>
        The next day was Tuesday and I had to go back to work. To be honest (and don’t tell my boss this), it was hard to focus on my job knowing the Immediate Edge software was making me money.
        </p>

        <p>
        I snuck out to the bathroom a few times to check my profits, and they kept stacking up (with a small loss here and there). At the end of the day, before I put my kids to sleep,
        <span className={Styles.bold}> my account balance showed AU$1,349.13.</span>
          That’s more than I earn in a WEEK at my regular job!

        By the end of the week, I made a total of 
        <span className={Styles.bold}>AU$5,349.12 AUD.</span>
         I withdrew exactly AU$4,500 and re-invested the rest. Within 2 days I received my first cheque in the mail - for exactly AU$4,500. I couldn’t believe this was real life!"

        <p>
        This wouldn’t be possible without Mr. Warne’s generosity and sharing his secret live on television. And I’m happy I took the risk to try Immediate Edge myself. My wife is happier than ever and my kids’ toy cupboard is well stocked.

        HOW TO GET STARTED WITH IMMEDIATE EDGE (LIMITED SPOTS AVAILABLE)
        </h6>

        <p>
        To get started, you only need your computer, smartphone, or tablet with internet access. You don't need any specific skills other than knowing how to use a computer and browsing the internet. You don’t need any technology or cryptocurrency experience because the software and your personal investor guarantees you make a profit.
        </p>

        <p>
        Another perk of this program is you get to start when you want. You can make your own schedule - whether that's 5 hours a week or 50 hours a week. Just start the auto-trading software when you wish, and you can pause whenever you want (I don’t know why you ever would though).

        HERE'S MY STEP-BY-STEP WALKTHROUGH:
        </h6>

        <p>
        The first thing you see is a video showing off the power of Immediate Edge. The advertising is big and bold and in your face, but it is an American product and that's how they do things. Anyway, you simply submit your name and email address next to the video to get started right away.

        (Tip: Even if you don't decide to invest any money, I recommend signing up now because it's free and registrations for Australia residents could end at any moment)

        Next up, you're asked to fund your account. As I was navigating the deposit page, my mobile rang. It was an international number so I was hesitant to answer but then I realised it was obviously from.

        Sure enough, it was my own personal account manager. His service was great. He took me through the entire funding process. They accept all major credit cards like Visa, MasterCard and American Express. I went ahead and deposited the minimum amount which is AU$350.

        Once funded, I navigated to the "Auto-Trader" section of software, set the trade amount to the recommended AU$50 and enabled it. The software started making trades at a rapid rate and I was concerned at first but let it do its thing.
